/** 
 * @brief Determine whether or not coordinates (query points) are completely inside a static polygon
 * 
 * Note: The polygon must not have holes or intersect with itself, but it is not
 * required to be convex.
 * 
 * The polygon is defined by a set of coordinates (latitudes and longitudes),
 * where the first and last coordinates must have the same value (closed).
 * 
 * This function supports clockwise and counter-clockwise polygons.
 * 
 * If a query point is colinear with two contiguous polygon coordinates
 * then this query point isn't inside.
 * 
 * polygon_latitudes and polygon_longitudes must have equal size.
 * 
 * point_latitudes and point_longitudes must have equal size.
 * 
 * All input params must have equal datatypes (for numeric operations).
 *
 * @param[in] polygon_latitudes: column with latitudes of a polygon
 * @param[in] polygon_longitudes: column with longitudes of a polygon
 * @param[in] query_point_latitudes: column with latitudes of query points
 * @param[in] query_point_longitudes: column with longitudes of query points
 * @param stream Optional CUDA stream on which to execute kernels
 *
 * @returns gdf_column of type GDF_BOOL8 indicating whether the i-th query point is inside (true) or not (false)
